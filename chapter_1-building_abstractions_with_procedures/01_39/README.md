# Problem

A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was published in 1770 by the German math-
ematician J.H. Lambert:

$$
\tan x = \displaystyle \frac{x}{1 - \frac{x^2}{3 - \frac{x^2}{5 - \cdots}}}
$$

where `x` is in radians. Define a procedure `(tan-cf x k)` that computes an approximation to the tangent function based on Lambertâ€™s formula. `k` specifies the number of terms to compute, as in Exercise 1.37.
