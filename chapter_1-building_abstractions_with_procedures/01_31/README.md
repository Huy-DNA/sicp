# Problem

a. The `sum` procedure is only the simplest of a vast number of similar abstractions that can be captured as higher-order procedures. Write an analogous procedure called `product` that returns the product of the values of a function at points over a given range. Show how to define factorial in terms of product. Also use `product` to compute approximations to Ï€ using the formula:

$$\frac{n}{4} = \frac{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \cdots}{3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 7 \cdots}$$

b. If your `product` procedure generates a recursive process, write one that generates an iterative process. If it generates an iterative process, write one that generates a recursive process.
