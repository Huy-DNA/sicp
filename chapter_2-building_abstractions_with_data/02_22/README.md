# Problem

Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first `square-list` procedure of Exercise 2.21 so that it evolves an iterative process:

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons (square (car things))
                    answer))))
  (iter items nil))
```

Unfortunately, defining `square-list` this way produces the answer list in the reverse order of the one desired. Why? Louis then tries to fix his bug by interchanging the arguments to `cons`:

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons answer
                    (square (car things))))))
  (iter items nil))
```

This doesnâ€™t work either. Explain.

# Answer

The original `square-list` produces the answer list in the reverse order because it tries to prepend the current element to the built-up `answer` list.

The second `square-list` won't work either because it tries to `cons` a list with a scalar, not the other way around.
