# Problem

We specified that a set would be represented as a list with no duplicates. Now suppose we allow duplicates. For instance, the set `{1, 2, 3}` could be represented as the list `(2 3 2 1 3 2 2)`. Design procedures `element-of-set?`, `adjoin-set`, `union-set`, and `intersection-set` that operate on this representation. How does the efficiency of each compare with the corresponding procedure for the non-duplicate representation? Are there applications for which you would use this representation in preference to the non-duplicate one?

# Answer

```scheme
(define (element-of-set? x set)
  (cond ((null? set) false)
        ((equal? x (car set)) true)
        (else (element-of-set? x (cdr set)))))

(define (adjoin-set x set)
  (cons x set))

(define (intersection-set s1 s2)
  (cond ((or (null? s1) (null? s2)) null)
        ((element-of-set? (car s1) s2) (cons (car s1) (intersection-set (cdr s1) s2)))
        (else (intersection-set (cdr s1) s2))))

(define (union-set s1 s2)
  (cond ((null? s1) s2)
        ((element-of-set? (car s1) s2) (union-set (cdr s1) s2))
        (else (cons (car s1) (union-set (cdr s1) s2)))))
```

Only `adjoin-set` is different and now takes constant time, other operations are more expensive, depending on the level of duplication. Applications that would prefer this representation are those that needs to add to a set often but occasionally performs lookup, intersection, union.
