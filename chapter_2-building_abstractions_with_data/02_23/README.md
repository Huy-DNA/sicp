# Problem

The procedure `for-each` is similar to `map`. It takes as arguments a procedure and a list of elements. However, rather than forming a list of the results, `for-each` just applies the procedure to each of the elements in turn, from left to right. The values returned by applying the procedure to the elements are not used at all—`for-each` is used with procedures that perform an action, such as printing. For example,

```scheme
(for-each (lambda (x)
            (newline)
            (display x))
         (list 57 321 88))
57
321
88
```

The value returned by the call to `for-each` (not illustrated above) can be something arbitrary, such as `true`. Give an implementation of `for-each`.

# Answer

```scheme
(define (for-each f l)
  (cond ((null? l) null)
        (else (f (car l))
              (for-each f (cdr l)))))
```
