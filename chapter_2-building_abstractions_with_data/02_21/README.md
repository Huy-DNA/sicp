# Problem

The procedure `square-list` takes a list of numbers as argument and returns a list of the squares of those numbers.

```scheme
(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
(1 4 9 16)
```

Here are two different definitions of `square-list`. Complete both of them by filling in the missing expressions:

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (if (null? items)
    nil
    (cons ⟨??⟩ ⟨??⟩)))
(define (square-list items)
  (map ⟨??⟩ ⟨??⟩))
```

# Answer

Non-map version:

  ```scheme
  (define (square-list items)
    (if (null? items)
      nil
      (cons (square (car items))
            (square-list (cdr items)))))
  ```

Map version:

  ```scheme
  (define (square-list items)
    (map square items))
  ```
