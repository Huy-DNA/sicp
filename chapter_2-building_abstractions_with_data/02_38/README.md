# Problem

The `accumulate` procedure is also known as `fold-right`, because it combines the first element of the sequence with the result of combining all the elements to the right. There is also a `fold-left`, which is similar to `fold-right`, except that it combines elements working in the opposite direction:

```scheme
(define (fold-left op initial sequence)
  (define (iter result rest)
    (if (null? rest)
      result
      (iter (op result (car rest))
            (cdr rest))))
  (iter initial sequence))
```

What are the values of:

```scheme
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left list nil (list 1 2 3))
```

Give a property that `op` should satisfy to guarantee that `fold-right` and `fold-left` will produce the same values for any sequence.

# Answer

Assuming that `/` is a floating-point division and regardless of precision, the first 2 should produce the same result.

The latter twos produce reversed results:

```scheme
(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3)) ; (1 (2 (3 ())))
(fold-left list nil (list 1 2 3)) ; (((() 1) 2) 3)
```
