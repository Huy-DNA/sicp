# Problem

Extend the differentiation program to handle sums and products of arbitrary numbers of (two or more) terms. Then the last example above could be expressed as
```scheme
(deriv '(* x y (+ x 3)) 'x)
```
Try to do this by changing only the representation for sums and products, without changing the deriv procedure at all. For example, the addend of a sum would be the first term, and the augend would be the sum of the rest of the terms

# Answer

Use recursion:
- `(+ x1 x2 x3 ...)` -> `u=x1`, `v=(+ x2 x3 ...)`
- `(* x1 x2 x3 ...)` -> `u=x1`, `v=(* x2 x3 ...)`
