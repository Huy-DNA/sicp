# Building abstractions with data

- The ability to construct compound data objects enables us to deal with data at a higher conceptual level than that of the primitive data objects of the language.

- Example: Rational numbers & the operation `add-rat` which computes the sum of two rationals
  - We can represent a rational number by 2 integers: a numerator and a denominator.
  - The operation `add-rat` would be implemented as 2 operations: One producing the numerator of the sum and one producing the denominator of the sum.
  -> It would better if we could "glue together" a numerator and denominator to form a pair (*coumpound data object*).
  -> We can regard rational number as a single conceptual unit.

- The use of *compound data* increases the modularity of programs:
  - We can treat a rational number as a whole instead of parts.
  - The part of our program that deals with rational numbers do not have to care about how the rational numbers may be presented.

- *Data abstraction*: The general technique of isolating the parts of a program that deal with *how data objects are represented* from the parts of a program that deal with how *data objects are used* is a powerful design methodology.

- Some key ideas:
  - *Data abstraction* enables us to erect suitable *abstraction barriers* between different parts of a program.
  - Prodedures alone can be used to form compound data, without any special "data" operations whatsoever. -> Blur the distinction between data and procedures.
  - *Closure* (a mathematical property) - The glue we use for combining data objects should allow us to combine compound data objects as well.
  - *Conventional interfaces* - A compound data object that can serve as an interface that allows multiple program modules to be combined in mix-and-match ways.
  - The choice of data representation can have significant impact on the time and space requirements of processes that manipulate the data.
  - *Generic operations* - Operations that must handle many different types of data/representations of data.
  - *Data-directed programming* - Allow individual data representation to be designed in isolation and combined *additively* (without modification).

## Introduction to data abstraction

- Procedure:
  - The details of how the procedure was implemented could be suppressed.
  - The particular procedure itself could be replaced by any other procedures with the same overall behavior.
  -> The analogous notion for compound data is called *data abstraction*.

- Basic ideas of *data abstraction*:
  - Structure the programs that are to use compound data objects so that they operate on "abstract data" or the programs should make no assumptions about the data.
  - A *concrete data representation* is defined independent of the programs that use the data.
  - The interface between these 2 parts of our system will be a set of procedures, called *selectors* and *constructors*, which implement the abstract data in terms of the concret representation.
