# Problem

Modify your `reverse` procedure of Exercise 2.18 to produce a `deep-reverse` procedure that takes a list as argument and returns as its value the list with its elements reversed and with all sublists deep-reversed as well.

For example,

```scheme
(define x (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))
x
((1 2) (3 4))
(reverse x)
((3 4) (1 2))
(deep-reverse x)
((4 3) (2 1))
```

# Answer

See `main.rkt`.
