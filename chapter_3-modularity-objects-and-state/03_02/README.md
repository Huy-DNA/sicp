## Question

 In software-testing applications, it is useful to be able to count the number of times a given procedure is called during the course of a computation. Write a procedure make-monitored that takes as input a procedure, `f`, that itself takes one input. The result returned by `make-monitored` is a third procedure, say `mf`, that keeps track of the number of times it has been called by maintaining an internal counter. If the input to `mf` is the special symbol `how-many-calls?`, then `mf` returns the value of the counter.
If the input is the special symbol `reset-count`, then `mf` resets the counter to zero.
 For any other input, `mf` returns the result of calling `f` on that input and increments the counter. For instance, we could make a monitored version of the `sqrt` procedure:

```scheme
(define s (make-monitored sqrt))
(s 100)
10
(s 'how-many-calls?)
1
```

## Answer

```scheme
(define (make-monitored f)
  (let ((counter 0))
    (lambda (arg)
        (cond ((= arg 'how-many-calls) counter)
              ((= arg 'reset-count) (set! counter 0))
              (else (begin (set! counter (+ counter 1))
                           (f arg)))))))
```
