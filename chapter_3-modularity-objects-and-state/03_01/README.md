## Question

An accumulator is a procedure that is called repeatedly with a single numeric argument and accumulates its arguments into a sum. Each time it is called, it returns the currently accumulated sum. Write a procedure `make-accumulator` that generates accumulators, each maintaining an independent sum. The input to `make-accumulator` should specify the initial value of the sum; for example

```scheme
(define A (make-accumulator 5))
(A 10)
15
(A 10)
25
```

## Answer

```scheme
(define (make-accumulator initial)
  (lambda (adden)
    (begin (set! initial (+ initial adden))
           initial)))
```
